# modulus-recursive

this little experiment ha staught me that 'main' isn't just a re-skinned 'master', they are 2 different branches, which makes hecka sense

fixed by making master default branch and baleeting main

then cloned, cleaned up files in bash and pushed
git@github.com:LLLisa/modulus-recursive.git
hecka fun if you're into that sorta thing
