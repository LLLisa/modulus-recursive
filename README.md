# modulus-recursive

this little experiment ha staught me that 'main' isn't just a re-skinned 'master', they are 2 different branches, which makes hecka sense

fixed by making master default branch and baleeting main
then cloned, cleaned up files in bash and pushed
hecka fun if you're into that sorta thing
